<p>Before joining CMU, I was a Principal Member of Technical Staff at Oracle.  I was fortunate to have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagdish/" target="_blank">Jagdish Chand</a> as my manager at Oracle (and before that at Visa).</p>

 <p>I moved to the Bay Area in 2015 to work at Visa Inc. after finishing my Master's in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/" target="_blank"> IIT Bombay</a>. For my thesis, I was advised by <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/" target="_blank">Prof. Sunita Sarawagi</a>, <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mausam/" target="_blank">Prof. Mausam</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/" target="_blank">Prof. Ganesh</a> on <a href="/projects/numrel" target="_blank">extracting numerical relations from text</a>.</p>

<p>More about me: <a href="/industry" target="_blank">industry experience</a>, <a href="/projects" target="_blank">projects,</a> <a href="/res/artifacts/aman_madaan_cv.pdf" target="_blank">cv</a>, <a href="/blog" target="_blank">blog (sparsely populated)</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/988966/axiom?tab=answers" target="_blank">stackoverflow profile</a>.</p>
 <p>I also enjoy <a href="/hiking" target="_blank">hiking</a>, swimming, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/88417239-aman-madaan?shelf=favorites&utf8=%E2%9C%93">reading</a> and aimlessly driving while listening to all kinds of music.</p>
