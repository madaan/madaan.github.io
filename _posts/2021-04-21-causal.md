title: Causal Inference
scribble: "true"
---

- [[Causality]]
- We are not interested in determining how one variable affects the other; we want to know the causal affects.
- Counterfactual: "What would happen if I had set X=j instead of X=i?"
- Intervention: "What would happen if I set X=i?"
    - Counterfactual questions are strictly more difficult to answer.
- ^^Conditional ATE:^^
    - Expectation that a treatment works for a single person

- ^^ATE:^^
    - Average treatment effect across the samples

    - $$Y_1$$ is the [[Potential Outcomes]] for the outcome when the treatment is given
- ^^Fundamental problem of causal inference:^^
    - We only observe one of the two outcomes for an individual.
    - However, for groups we might know the phenomenon.

    - The figure is misleading: ATE is ACROSS the samples, so it is just A number. ATE is not a function of $$x$$: it gives an overall picture.
- Difference between the naive ATE and counterfactual ATE:

        - Conditioning != computing the counterfactual.
